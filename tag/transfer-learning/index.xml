      <description>&lt;p&gt;\&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\  \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;\   \   \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My BSc thesis under the supervision of Prof. Rabiee was
about Applications of Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout my research on self-driving cars (SDV),
I was impressed by the reinforcement learning algorithms&amp;rsquo; effect on SDV, but these algorithms heavily rely on expensive sensors like LiDAR, multi-camera, and 3d-camera, etc. which is conducive to the high price of such vehicles these days. Therefore, I was inclined to avoid the collisions only with the help of a single camera (monocular image) and high-level feature extractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in this thesis, I have tried to train in a simulator to minimize real-world collision due to such systems&amp;rsquo; criticality and deployed transfer learning methods to handle distribution shifts between simulation and real-world images.&lt;/p&gt;
