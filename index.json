Therefore, I was inclined to avoid the collisions only with the help of a single camera (monocular image) and high-level feature extractor.\nMoreover, in this thesis, I have tried to train in a simulator to minimize real-world collision due to such systems' criticality and deployed transfer learning methods to handle distribution shifts between simulation and real-world images.\n","date":1582502400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582502400,"objectID":"7e315737a3cb72a043551054155b3bb1","permalink":"https://amirshahid.github.io/project/bs-project/","publishdate":"2020-02-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bs-project/","section":"project","summary":"My BSc thesis under the supervision of Prof. Rabiee on Applications of Transfer Learning in Reinforcement Learning.","tags":["Transfer Learning"],"title":"Transfer Learning in RL","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Medical Image Scanner - press space -\n Features  Fast Smart Accurate Remote   Super Resolution Camera  Cell Segmentation wanna see?\nOne  Two  Three \n Isn\u0026rsquo;t it better?
